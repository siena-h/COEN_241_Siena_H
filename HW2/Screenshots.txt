Description: This is the Screenshot explanation file for the .png files in this directory. 

invoke_figlet.png: shows results of invoking figlet for input "Hello, FaaS, world from Siena"
	Note: I decided to pass the string "Hello, FaaS, world from Siena" with my name as further proof besides the screenshot that I was the one running it. 
	From the information provided in the faas-figlet GitHub, it appears the purpose of figlet is to create a serverless ascii banner to display the string that was entered, and this is exactly what happened.
