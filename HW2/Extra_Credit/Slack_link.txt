More information if necessary: 
I ran my app inside the SCU ACM-W Slack in the #random channel. The slash command was /test241. 

Here I have provided an invite link to that Slack so that you can check out the app yourself if necessary. As I doubt I will be running ngrok 24/7 from now until the homework is graded, it may not be possible to verify operation, but I should be able to add you as a collaborator to the app after you have joined so you can see the configurations if necessary.
